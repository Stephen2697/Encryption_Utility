/*Program Information:
This is a 5 option menu driven program which utilises encryption and decryption functionality...
-This program takes in a User's specified 4 digit access code
-Once stored an encryption algorithm is applied
-Subsequently this code is Verified against the official 4 digit (encrypted) access code - array type int
Note: this is a modularised program with multiple functions.
Note: this program utilises pointer notation EXCLUSIVELY.*/

Function: main()
Functionality: In this C program main() acts as a skeleton function. 
This function operates to output the program menu, tackle menu selections 
and finally to implement a subsequent switch statement to call the neccessary 
sub-functions in this modularly-designed Program.
